## Paper Information

**Title**: Sector Rotation by Factor Model and Fundamental Analysis
**Authors**: Runjia Yang, Beining Shi
**arXiv ID**: [2401.00001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00001)

### Abstract

This study presents an analytical approach to sector rotation, leveraging both factor models and fundamental metrics. We initiate with a systematic classification of sectors, followed by an empirical investigation into their returns. Through factor analysis, the paper underscores the significance of momentum and short-term reversion in dictating sectoral shifts. A subsequent in-depth fundamental analysis evaluates metrics such as PE, PB, EV-to-EBITDA, Dividend Yield, among others. Our primary contribution lies in developing a predictive framework based on these fundamental indicators. The constructed models, post rigorous training, exhibit noteworthy predictive capabilities. The findings furnish a nuanced understanding of sector rotation strategies, with implications for asset management and portfolio construction in the financial domain.

## Constitutional Principles Applied

This review was conducted under the principles defined in `SCIENTIFIC_PRINCIPLES.md`:

1. **Methodological Neutrality** — Non-mainstream hypotheses receive equal evaluation
2. **Separation of Concerns** — Methodology ≠ Conclusions ≠ Implications
3. **Anti-Orthodoxy Bias Control** — 'Contradicts consensus' triggers scrutiny, not rejection
4. **COI Awareness** — Surface conflicts without guilt-by-association
5. **Progress-of-Science Test** — Value contributions even when wrong

## Multi-Axis Verdict

Scientific quality is multidimensional. Scores reflect distinct aspects:

| Dimension | Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Methodological Soundness** | 3/5 | Design quality, controls, execution |
| **Evidence Strength** | 3/5 | Data adequacy, statistical rigor |
| **Novelty Value** | 3/5 | Originality of question, method, or data |
| **Scientific Contribution** | 3/5 | Usefulness to field, even if wrong |
| **Risk of Overreach** | 3/5 | Gap between data and claims |

### Rationale

Verdict JSON parse failed; placeholder scores used.

## Methodological Review

**Scope**: Experimental design, controls, statistics (independent of conclusions)

- **note**: Methodology review unavailable (LLM JSON parse failed).

---

## Evidence Sufficiency

**Scope**: Does data support conclusions? Are citations accurate?

- **note**: Evidence review unavailable (LLM JSON parse failed).

**CRITICAL**: This section provides INFORMATION, not DISQUALIFICATION.

Presence of conflicts does not invalidate work; absence does not validate it.

## Limitations of This Review

This review has the following limitations:

- **No access to raw data** — Could not verify data directly
- **PDF extraction limitations** — Text extraction may be incomplete
- **Limited author research** — COI analysis may be incomplete
- **Single review** — No independent replication of evaluation

### Extraction / Tooling Limitations (Run-Specific)

- Claim extraction JSON parse failed; fell back to heuristic claims from abstract.
- Methodology JSON parse failed; findings may be incomplete.
- Evidence JSON parse failed; findings may be incomplete.
- Verdict JSON parse failed; placeholder verdict used.
### Uncertainty Acknowledgment

This review provides structured analysis, not definitive truth.

Areas of uncertainty:
- Whether all relevant alternative explanations were considered
- Whether cited literature was fully representative
- Whether subtle methodological issues were detected

**'We don't know' is a valid conclusion.**
